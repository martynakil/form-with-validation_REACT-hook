<h1> form validation with EMAILJS </h1>


>from the series: I'm learning React! :muscle:

----

*My task was to create the form along with the form validation. When the user fills in all fields, a message will be sent*


**I used [EMAIL JS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) here.**

*EmailJS helps to send emails using client-side technologies only. No server is required – just connect EmailJS to one of the supported email services, create an email template, and use our Javascript library to trigger an email.*

<h3>What did I use in the project? What have I learned?</h3>


* I practiced REACT [HOOKS](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)
* How to divide a task into several modules (so that the code is more readable and that one module does not have several functions)
* how to use [conditional statement](https://www.robinwieruch.de/conditional-rendering-react)
* how to create a form and retrieve data entered by the user

<h3>How to open a file? :eyes: </h3>

* On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.
* An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.)
* Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.
* you must enter the appropriate folder (command "cd" + file name)
* you must to install all packages via *npm install*
* then you can start *npm start*
